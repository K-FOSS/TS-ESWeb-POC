# K-FOSS/TS-ESWeb-POC

## VERY WORK IN PROGRESS

This is a WIP proof of concept of using the TypeScript compiler API, my @K-FOSS/TS-ESNode module, and new Import maps for using ESModules and TypeScript in the browser with live transpile of TypeScript code.

## Development

This template is designed to be developed within a VSCode Remote Container. When you open is VSCode you should get a notification prompting to reopen in container.
